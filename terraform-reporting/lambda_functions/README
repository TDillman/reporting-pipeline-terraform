This module creates the three Lambda functions required for our Mode reporting POC, as well as their dependencies.
IAM roles, policies, and role attachments are contained in this module.

Once the Lambda functions are written, we can work out how to reference the source code in each resource.

Lambda environment variables go into AWS Secrets Manager
