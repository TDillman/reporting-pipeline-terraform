This template will create the SQS queues, Lambda functions, IAM roles/policies, S3 buckets, and Athena
resources for the reporting POCs to function.

API credentials are in ./creds

Lambda environment variables should be put in AWS Secrets Manager

---------

To create deployments (a $VALUE denotes a user-defined value during deployment):
    terraform workspace new $ENVIRONMENT (e.g. dev-us, test-eu, prod-us)
    terraform workspace select $ENVIRONMENT
    terraform init
    terraform plan -var "region=$REGION"
    terraform apply -var "region=$REGION"
        Defining the "region" variable in the command line will allow us to tag all resources that allow tags with their
        environment.
        
---------

The templates use the current workspace name as the environment variable, so whatever workspace is currently selected
will dictate that workspace and have a separate state file.

My recommendation would be to set up workspaces for each environment and location:
dev-us
dev-eu
test-us
test-eu
prod-us
prod-eu
